> Every year we have dozens of year 12 students that join us on our Computer Science A-Level course who have not taken Computing for a GCSE.Often these students will struggle to keep up with the course content without the background in programming basics that I would have covered in years 10-11.Computing is for everyone and it shouldn't seem impossible to learn to code. Whether you‚Äôre a Computing student or not, this course is set up to teach you the basics of Python programming.If you like what you see, please share this with people who you think may benefit. If not please raise an issue on GitHub https://github.com/bitFez/BitFez-s-Learning-to-code-in-Python-Roadmap/issuesThe roadmap has been split into several weeks worth of tasks. If you are a noob coder, you should not be doing less than 10 hours a week on this roadmap (and other resources alongside it). The whole point of this, is to help you get those basic GCSE level programming skills under üîí & üîë. üÜò Help can be asked for here: Discussions ¬∑ bitFez/BitFez-s-Learning-to-code-in-Python-Roadmap ¬∑ GitHub  

# The Roadmap (Updated 15/02/2022)

## Step 0 - The setup

I generally always start my teaching with online IDEs. Teaching to set up a coding environment and how to save and retrieve files can be overwhelming for some at first.

To begin with, it‚Äôs perfectly fine to start with Repl and then move on to another IDE if/when you need it.
