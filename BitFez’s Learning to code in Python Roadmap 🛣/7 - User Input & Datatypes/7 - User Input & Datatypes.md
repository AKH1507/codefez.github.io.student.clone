Input is a key function when programming. Do you remember the pokÃ©mon picture from the variables page?

We need to be able to take data from users. This enables us to write programs with different outcomes.

  

## Example input

```Python
name = input("What's your name hero?")
```

As you can see from the example above, we need to start the input statement using a variable. Then we use the input keyword function.

> [!important]  
> The default datatype for an input is a string. So anything that is saved in the variable after the input will be saved in quotes " "We can change this ... ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘‡  

  

## Example input for an integer

```Python
age = int(input("How old are you?"))
```

## Example input for a float

```Python
price = float(input("How much for that doggie in the window?"))
```

Here you can see this in action above.  
ðŸ’¡ Also notice the function I havenâ€™t used before  
`type()` which returns the datatype of an object
