The most basic skill to learn when coding is how to output a message to the screen.

We must use a function to do this. In python the keyword for this function is `print()`. Python will take whatever is between the parenthesis and output it to the screen.

  

> [!important]  
> 3 key rules you need to know to begin with:1. print is always written in lowercase. In fact, all python keyword commands are.2. There must always be parenthesis and whatever is to be outputted must be placed within the ( ).3. Text that is outputted must be placed within quotes " "
